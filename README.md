# A Sargassum farm model

This is a tiny website to simulate the amount of CO2 a Sargassum farm in the open ocean could potentially sequester.

For now, you can change three settings: Average mat thickness, farm size and wet weight per square meter. From these, the total weight of Sargassum is calculated.

Of course, this is pretending to have one fixed point in time. The inputs are only averages, so in the end this is just a very rough and totally not accurate approximation.
